**You need to add 19 more cards!**

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### 1. Customize Existing Cards
Edit `src/data/custom-cards/customCardDatabase.json`:
- Update the 5 example cards with your own personal messages
- Change flavor text to reference your real memories
- Adjust Pokemon choices to ones meaningful to you

### 2. Create 19 More Cards
Add cards for days: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23

Use this template:
```json
{
  "id": "custom-XXX",
  "baseCardId": "POKEMON-CARD-ID",
  "name": "Your Custom Name",
  "flavorText": "Your personal message",
  "assignedDay": X,
  "category": "milestone"
}
```

### 3. Find Pokemon Card IDs
Visit https://pokemontcg.io/ and search for Pokemon. Use the card ID (e.g., `base1-58` for Pikachu)

### 4. Test Your Calendar
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and click the "Advent" button

## 🎨 Design & UX Features

- **Door States**:
  - Locked (future dates) - Gray with lock icon
  - Today - Gold pulsing with "TODAY" badge
  - Available - Red with gift icon
  - Opened - Green with checkmark
- **Progress Display**: Shows X/24 days completed
- **Hover Effects**: Doors lift and shine on hover
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works great on all screen sizes

### Pack Opening
- **Loading State**: Animated spinner while generating pack
- **Pack Animation**: Reuses existing pack opening animation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Pack Distribution Logic
```typescript
Day 1-13:   [Custom Cards] + 0 Rare + 2 Uncommon + X Common = 10 cards
Day 14-19:  [Custom Cards] + 1 Rare + 2 Uncommon + X Common = 10 cards
Day 20-23:  [Custom Cards] + 1 Rare + 3 Uncommon + X Common = 10 cards
Day 24:     [Custom Cards] + 2 Rare + 3 Uncommon + X Common = 10 cards
```

### Date Logic
- Doors unlock at midnight local time
- Progress persists in localStorage
- Each door can only be opened once
- System validates dates before allowing access

### Data Flow
```
User clicks door → Check if available → Generate pack → Fetch base cards →
Merge with custom data → Show pack animation → Display cards → Save progress
```
