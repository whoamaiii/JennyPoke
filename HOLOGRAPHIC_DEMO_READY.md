### Controls to Play With
- **Intensity Slider** (0-2): Adjust how strong the effect is
  - 0 = No effect
  - 1 = Normal (default)
  - 2 = Super intense
- **Rotation Slider** (0-30°): Control how much the card tilts
  - 0° = No rotation
  - 20° = Normal (default)
  - 30° = Extreme tilt

## 💡 How to Use in Your Project

Once you like what you see, here's how to apply it:

### Option 1: Add to Specific Cards
```typescript
import { useHolographicEffect } from '@/hooks/useHolographicEffect';
import '@/styles/holographic.css';

function MyCard() {
  const { cardRef } = useHolographicEffect({
    enabled: true,
    intensity: 1,
    rotationLimit: 20
  });

  return (
    <div ref={cardRef} className="holo-card fire" data-rarity="rare holo">
      <div className="holo-card__translater">
        <div className="holo-card__rotator">
          <div className="holo-card__front">
            <img src="card-image.png" alt="Card" />
            <div className="holo-card__shine" />
            <div className="holo-card__glare" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎄 Perfect for Advent Calendar

### Imagine This:

**Without Holographic:**
```
Day 1 Custom Card: 📄 [Static Image] + 🟡 Border
```

**With Holographic:**
```
Day 1 Custom Card: ✨💎🌈 [Shimmering Card] + 🟡 Border
Day 24 Charizard:  🌌✨💎 [Galaxy Effect] + 🟡 Border + 🎆
```

The holographic effect makes your custom cards feel like **actual premium Pokemon cards**!

## 🎮 Try These Things

1. **Move mouse slowly** - See the rainbow shift smoothly
2. **Move to corners** - Watch maximum rotation
3. **Move fast** - See how smoothly it tracks
4. **Leave and return** - See the reset animation
5. **Adjust intensity to 2** - Experience full effect
6. **Set rotation to 0** - Pure shine, no tilt
7. **Set rotation to 30** - Extreme 3D effect

---

## 📊 Performance

- ✅ **60fps** on modern devices
- ✅ **Hardware accelerated** (uses GPU)
- ✅ **Smooth animations** via RequestAnimationFrame
- ✅ **Reduced motion support** (respects accessibility)
- ✅ **Mobile compatible** (touch events supported)

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### What You Can Change:
- **Intensity** (0-2): Subtle to dramatic
- **Rotation Limit** (0-30°): Flat to extreme tilt
- **Colors**: Modify rainbow gradient colors
- **Card Types**: Different Pokemon types get different glows
- **Effect Types**: Regular holo, cosmos, rainbow (can add more)

## 🔧 Technical Details (If You're Curious)

### How It Works:
1. **Mouse Position Tracked** - Converted to percentages
2. **CSS Variables Updated** - Real-time via JavaScript
3. **3D Transform Applied** - rotateX/rotateY based on position
4. **Gradient Shifted** - Background position follows cursor
5. **Glare Positioned** - Radial gradient at cursor location

### CSS Magic:
- **`mix-blend-mode: color-dodge`** - Creates holographic shine
- **`transform-style: preserve-3d`** - Enables 3D space
- **`will-change`** - Optimizes for GPU acceleration
- **Multiple layers** - Shine + Glare = Realistic effect
