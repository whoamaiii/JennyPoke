## Troubleshooting

### Animations Not Playing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `pack-opening.css` is imported
- Clear cache and reload

### Sounds Not Working
- Check `/public/sounds/` directory exists
- Ensure user has interacted with page (auto-play restrictions)
- Look for console warnings about missing files
- Mute/volume settings correct?

### Pack Selection Not Showing
- Check if button is enabled (cards downloaded?)
- Verify network connection for card downloads
- Check console for errors

### Performance Issues
- Use "Fast" animation speed
- Reduce confetti particleCount in components
- Close other browser tabs
