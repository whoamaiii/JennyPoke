## Adding Sounds

1. Download or create your sound files
2. Convert to MP3 if needed (use Audacity or online converter)
3. Name files exactly as listed above
4. Place in this `/public/sounds/` directory
5. Test in the app - sounds will auto-load

## Testing Without Sound Files

The app will work without sound files! The AudioManager includes:
- Error handling for missing files
- Console warnings (check browser dev tools)
- Graceful degradation (animations still play silently)

## Volume Levels

The AudioManager has preset volumes for each sound:
- pack-rustle: 60% volume
- pack-rip: 80% volume
- card-whoosh: 50% volume
- card-reveal: 60% volume
- rare-chime: 70% volume
- sparkle: 40% volume
- anticipation: 50% volume

These are multiplied by the master volume setting (default 70%).

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. **Normalize Audio**
- Use Audacity's "Normalize" effect
- Set to -3dB to prevent clipping
- Ensures consistent volume across all sounds

### 2. **Trim Silence**
- Remove dead space at start/end
- Makes sounds feel more responsive
- Reduces file size

### 3. **Compress for Web**
- Use MP3 encoding at 128-192 kbps
- Variable bit rate (VBR) for smaller files
- Test loading times on mobile

### 4. **Layer Sounds** (Optional)
- Combine multiple sounds in Audacity
- Add reverb to sparkle.mp3 for depth
- EQ adjustments for clarity

### 5. **Test on Different Devices**
- Mobile speakers (often limited bass)
- Headphones (full frequency range)
- Adjust volumes based on testing
