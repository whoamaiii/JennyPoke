## Adding Custom Images (Optional)

1. Create custom card images and save them in:
   ```
   public/custom-cards/
   ```

2. Reference them in your card JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "customImage": "christmas-charizard.png"
   }
   ```

3. The system will use this image instead of the base card image

## Tips for Great Custom Cards

1. **Personal Memories**: Use flavor text to reference specific memories
2. **Inside Jokes**: Include jokes or references only you two understand
3. **Progressive Story**: Build up to Day 24 with increasingly special cards
4. **Balance**: Mix funny, sweet, and heartfelt cards
5. **Variety**: Use different Pokemon types to keep it interesting

## Testing During Development

To test the calendar before December:

1. The calendar shows all 24 doors
2. During development, you can modify the date checks in `useAdventProgress.ts`
3. For production, doors automatically unlock on their respective dates

## Current Setup

The template includes 5 sample cards assigned to days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 24. You should:

1. Customize these cards with your own messages
2. Add 19 more cards for the remaining days
3. Ensure each day (1-24) has at least one custom card

## Resetting Progress

Progress is stored in localStorage with key `advent-calendar-2024`. To reset:
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Application/Storage ‚Üí Local Storage
- Delete the `advent-calendar-2024` key
- Or use the reset function in the browser console:
  ```javascript
  localStorage.removeItem('advent-calendar-2024')
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Cards not loading
- Check the Pokemon TCG API key in `.env.local`
- Verify `baseCardId` values are valid
- Check browser console for errors

### Wrong day showing as available
- Check system date/time settings
- Verify date logic in `useAdventProgress.ts`

### Custom images not showing
- Ensure images are in `public/custom-cards/`
- Check file names match `customImage` field
- Verify image file extensions
