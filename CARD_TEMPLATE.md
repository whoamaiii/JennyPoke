## Writing Great Flavor Text

### Good Examples
‚úÖ "Remember when we got lost in the rain and found that tiny caf√©? Best mistake ever."
‚úÖ "You make terrible pancakes but I love them anyway ü•û"
‚úÖ "That time you sang karaoke off-key - I fell even harder for you."
‚úÖ "Every adventure is better with you by my side."

### Avoid
‚ùå "We had fun" (too generic)
‚ùå "You're nice" (too basic)
‚ùå "That was cool" (no specific memory)

### Tips
- Be specific! Mention actual events, places, or things
- Use their sense of humor
- Reference inside jokes
- Mix sweet and funny
- Don't be afraid to be cheesy on Day 24
